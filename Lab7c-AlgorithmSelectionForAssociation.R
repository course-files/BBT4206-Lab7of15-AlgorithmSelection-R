# **Required Lab Work Submission** ----
## Part A ----
# Create a new file called
# "Lab7-Submission-AlgorithmSelection.R".
# Provide all the code you have used to demonstrate the training of a model.
# This can be a model for a classification, regression, clustering, or an
# association problem.
# Each group member should provide one dataset that can be used for this
# task as long as it is not one of the datasets we have used in Lab 7.

## Part B ----
# Upload *the link* to your
# "Lab7-Submission-AlgorithmSelection.R" hosted
# on Github (do not upload the .R file itself) through the submission link
# provided on eLearning.

## Part C ----
# Create a markdown file called "Lab-Submission-Markdown.Rmd"
# and place it inside the folder called "markdown". Use R Studio to ensure the
# .Rmd file is based on the "GitHub Document (Markdown)" template when it is
# being created.

# Refer to the following file in Lab 1 for an example of a .Rmd file based on
# the "GitHub Document (Markdown)" template:
#     https://github.com/course-files/BBT4206-R-Lab1of15-LoadingDatasets/blob/main/markdown/BIProject-Template.Rmd # nolint

# Include Line 1 to 14 of BIProject-Template.Rmd in your .Rmd file to make it
# displayable on GitHub when rendered into its .md version

# It should have code chunks that explain all the steps performed on the
# datasets.

## Part D ----
# Render the .Rmd (R markdown) file into its .md (markdown) version by using
# knitR in RStudio.

# You need to download and install "pandoc" to render the R markdown.
# Pandoc is a file converter that can be used to convert the following files:

# Documentation:
#   https://pandoc.org/installing.html and
#   https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/wiki/R-Markdown

# By default, Rmd files are open as Markdown documents. To enable R Markdown
# features, you need to associate *.Rmd files with rmd language.
# Add an entry Item "*.Rmd" and Value "rmd" in the VS Code settings,
# "File Association" option.

# Documentation of knitR: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/

# Upload *the link* to "Lab-Submission-Markdown.md" (not .Rmd)
# markdown file hosted on Github (do not upload the .Rmd or .md markdown files)
# through the submission link provided on eLearning.
